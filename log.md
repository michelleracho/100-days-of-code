# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've decided to commit to the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I reviewed some JavaScript and also learned about color theory

**Thoughts**: I've been coding for a while now but I'm still not confident with myself. I'm hoping that this challenge will make me accountable for myself and help me become more confident that I will be a great developer!
