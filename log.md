# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've decided to commit to the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I reviewed some JavaScript and also learned about color theory

**Thoughts**: I've been coding for a while now but I'm still not confident with myself. I'm hoping that this challenge will make me accountable for myself and help me become more confident that I will be a great developer!

### Day 2: October 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed more JavaScript and skimmed through [Front-End Developer Handbook 2019](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/) and [2018](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/) by Frontend Masters. I also did a few data structures and algorithm problems

**Thoughts**: Although I'm pretty comfortable with HTML/CSS/Sass/basic JS, I'm weak at DSA exercises
